# Code Refactor Starter Code
# BCS-Module-1-Challenge

## Description

(Company POV)
This website was designed to effectively communicate our product and process to our customers. This will give our customers a brief overview of our main marketing strategies and advantages of utilizing our services. 

(My POV)
This refactoring project is the challenge assignment for Module 1 of the UNC Coding Bootcamp. This module and challenge were designed to give my class an opportunity for us to practice our basic HTML and CSS skills, including page design and layout, link functionality, accessibility, commenting in our code, and semantics.
